Steps for the simulation:
1) bash ./scripts/assembler.sh ./assembly_programs/<program>.asm
2) cp ./assembly_programs/<program>_dump.txt ./scripts/test.asm.mem
3) cd scripts
4) setmentor
5) vsim &
6) bash compile.bash
7) Set the parameters, resolution 10ps, apply full visibility and choose tb_cpu design
8) After design is loaded, add waves (Useful waves are tipically CLK,RST,CU/OPCODE, DP/RF/REGS, DATAMEM/MEM)
8) run simulation (for long programs such as division it is better to go straight to run 2us)

While design is loaded, to run other programs move in the main directory for simulation: DLX-Risc-uProcessor/sim and perform steps 1 and 2 and run "restart -f" in questasim, then perform step 8.
